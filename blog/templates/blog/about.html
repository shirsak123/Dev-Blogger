    <h1 class="about"> DEVBLOGGER is software designed for everyone, emphasizing accessibility,
        performance, security, and ease of use. We believe great software should work with
        minimum set up, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely.
        The basic DEVBLOGGER software is simple and predictable so you can easily get started.
        It also offers powerful features for growth and success.

        We believe in democratizing publishing and the freedoms that come with open source.
        Supporting this idea is a large community of people collaborating on and contributing
        to this project. The DEVBLOGGER community is welcoming and inclusive. Our contributorsâ€™
        passion drives the success of DEVBLOGGER which, in turn, helps you reach your goals.</h1>
